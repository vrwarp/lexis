# Agent Orchestration Guide

This document outlines the trigger rules and changelogs for the `lexis` translation team.

## Harness: lexis

**Goal:** Translate EPUB books sequentially chapter-by-chapter with strict glossary consolidation, error-checked validation, and critique.

**Trigger:** Use the `lexis-orchestrator` skill to run, manage, update, or check status on any task related to book translation, EPUB disbinding/packaging, glossary management, or translation production. Simple questions may be answered directly.

**Change Log:**
| Date | Change | Scope | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026-06-21 | Migrated legacy frontmatter-based md agents to standard subagent plugin structure under `agents/plugins/lexis-plugin/` | Global | Rebuild repository pipeline for shared Git tracking |
